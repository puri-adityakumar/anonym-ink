### 2.3 Create an ENV File

- Must be declared with "." at the start
- This file doesn't get pushed to the git repository (i.e., it's inside .gitignore)
- In industry-grade applications, since env files are not available, there exists a file named `.env.sample`

```
# Always prefix will start from VITE since we're using VITE, else it will show "undefined"
# To access any variable from file you need to use "import.meta.env.VITE_VAR_NAME"

########################################################################################

VITE_APPWRITE_URL="https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1"
VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID="6708d356001c2bda3cce"
VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID="6708d4410015fcc22d1e"
VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION="6708d4c9002a1fd5806a"
VITE_APPWRITE_BUCKET_ID="6708d6c9000ba2c34ea9"
```

- Creating `conf.js` file: src>conf>conf.js
- This file is created to avoid calling variables from env with long text. Sometimes, due to minor casualties, it can compromise the entire app, hence we use conf.js

```
const conf = {
    appwriteUrl: String(import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_URL),
    appwriteProjectId: String(import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID),
    appwriteDatabaseId: String(import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID),
    appwriteCollectionId: String(import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID),
    appwriteBucketId: String(import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_BUCKET_ID),
}
export default conf
```
